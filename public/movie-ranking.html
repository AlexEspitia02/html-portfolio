<h1>The Best Movies According to Alex</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

    <h3>Stillwater</h3>
    It's my favorite movie because the portrayal of every character's emotions and features is quite exquisite.

<p>
    <h3>The Soul</h3>
    It's a Taiwanese movie. The end of the plot has a reverse and every detail is reasonable. The movie 
    lets us think that all events originate from an evil spirit. Actually, it all happened with the medical technology.

    <h3>The Privilege</h3>
    Contrary to the movie "The Soul", this movie lets us think that all events originate from medical technology. 
    Actually, it all happened with the evil spirit.
